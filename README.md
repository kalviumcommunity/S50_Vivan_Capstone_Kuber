## Problem Statement

In today's digitalized world, numerous platforms facilitate seamless transactions, offering various incentives and rewards upon usage. These rewards often come in the form of coupons, discounts, or cashback from a plethora of brands and services. However, despite the abundance of rewards, many users overlook or ignore them, leading to underutilization of these benefits. This presents a significant opportunity for developing a tailored solution that optimizes the utilization of digital payment rewards. The challenge lies in creating a system that effectively identifies and addresses users' preferences and needs, thereby increasing engagement and incentivizing the redemption of rewards.

## Solution Statement

Our solution addresses the issue of underutilized coupons and vouchers by creating a centralized platform where users can upload and sell their unused digital coupons and vouchers from various brands. By providing a marketplace for these unused incentives, our website aims to minimize wastage while enabling users to benefit from discounted offers they might otherwise miss out on.

## Key Features

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: We will design an intuitive website interface that allows users to easily upload, browse, and purchase unused coupons and vouchers. The interface will be simple to navigate, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. **Secure Transactions**: Implement robust security measures to safeguard users' transactions and personal information. Utilize encryption protocols and secure payment gateways to provide a safe environment for buying and selling coupons and vouchers.

3. **Verification Process**: Implement a verification process to ensure the authenticity and validity of uploaded coupons and vouchers. This may involve verifying the expiration date, terms and conditions, and authenticity of the offer to maintain the integrity of the marketplace.

4. **Search and Filter Options**: Incorporate advanced search and filter options to help users find specific coupons and vouchers based on brand, category, discount percentage, or expiration date. This feature enhances usability and enables users to quickly locate desired offers.

Overall, our website serves as a solution to the problem of underutilized coupons and vouchers, offering a convenient platform for users to buy and sell unused incentives while maximizing value for both buyers and sellers.
